				<h1>Rotary Editor</h1>
				<p>
					I've been wondering what an "Alt + drag" interaction would
					look like in a traditional text editor.
				</p>

				<p>
					"Alt + drag" is an interaction in canvas apps like Figma
					that lets you quickly duplicate elements and explore
					different versions of your design. If you've seen what a
					designer's exploration board looks like, it's like a
					waterfall that might start narrow on the left-hand side but
					then broadens into a tree of versions on the right. The Alt
					+ drag interaction lets designers try out microdecisions and
					later walk their colleague through them with a "what if we
					went this way" story.
				</p>

				<p>
					Writing is similarly not linear - we double back, we try
					different approaches, we keep multiple versions in our head.
					Maybe our tools could better reflect this reality. An Alt +
					drag interaction already exists in text where you can make a
					quick copy of a phrase or paragraph to try out a different
					version. Here's the tricky part though - while Alt + drag in
					Figma keeps the whole composition right there for you to
					see, having multiple copies of paragraphs in your text
					totally breaks the flow. You really need to keep the rhythm
					of the text intact so you can feel how it all works
					together.
				</p>

				<p>
					The rotary editor (I might need a better name, suggestions
					welcome) is my interaction design experiment to see if we
					can bring a similar kind of exploration to writing. It lets
					you <em>rotate</em>, a.k.a try out, different versions of
					your paragraphs while keeping the natural flow of your text.
				</p>

				<p>
					When you're typing, hitting <kbd>CTRL + .</kbd> rotates the
					paragraph into its alternate version. At first, both
					versions are exactly the same. As you edit one version, the
					other stays unchanged, and you can flip between them anytime
					using the same shortcut. The key thing is that you're always
					reading one coherent flow of text - you just rotate
					paragraphs in place to see their different versions.
				</p>

				<p>
					I built this as a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript application
					using the classic <kbd>contenteditable = true</kbd> as the
					editor. No frameworks, no complex dependencies - just
					exploring what's possible with the basic building blocks of
					the web.
				</p>

				<p>
					There are still lots of questions to explore here: How do
					you visualize the relationship between alternates? What
					happens when you want to mix parts from different versions?
					How do you keep track of which alternatives you've tried as
					they accumulate?
				</p>

				<p>
					If you're interested in thinking about these questions, I'd
					love to hear your thoughts. I'm keeping this page as an
					evergreen note + prototype as I update it with further
					ideas.

				<div class="upcoming-changes">
					<p>In no particular order upcoming changes are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong
								>Better feedback about which version you are
								on</strong
							>. Currently the alternate version gets a blue hue
							and a â€¢ dot indicator in the right margin to show
							that this paragraph has an alternate version. This
							isn't quite so evident so I should explore better
							patterns here, e.g. toggling the background hue of
							the entire paragraph when it's on an alternate
							version, actually animating the rotation etc.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>More interface-driven version toggle</strong
							>. Currently you can only toggle using the
							<span class="key-command">CTRL+.</span> shortcut
							which although very nice for the user flow is not
							very discoverable. A better idea would be to show
							some kind of hover/tooltip/anything in the UI itself
							that a different version can be created or toggled.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>More granular version control</strong>.
							Right now you can only rotate entire paragraphs, but
							I might need to narrow down the interaction to allow
							you to rotate words, selected phrases etc. I'm
							hesitant to do this because engineering-wise this
							blows up the complexity quite a bit but I might get
							to it later.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>A Code/Prosemirror plugin</strong>. If this
							ends up being actually useful, I might explore
							productionizing the prototype into a Codemirror or
							Prosemirror plugin so it could actually be
							integrated into more interfaces.
						</li>
